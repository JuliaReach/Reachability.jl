Reachability analysis of high-dimensional affine systems with nondeterministic inputs.

## Introduction

This module provides an interface to set-based reachability algorithms for affine
systems with nondeterministic inputs. It implements several reachability
algorithms using decomposition into low-dimensional subsystems. The code is optimized
for high-dimensional linear systems.

ReachSets.jl relies in the following modules:

|Module name|Features|
|-----------|--------|
|`LazySets.jl`|Set-based representations and operations in the lazy framework. Support vector and support function calculus.|
|`MathematicalSystems.jl`|Representation and transformation of affine systems with non-deterministic inputs.|

The following dependencies are optional and provide additional functionality:

|Optional module name | Features|
|------|------|
|`Expokit.jl` | Fast computation of matrix exponential of very large and very sparse matrices.|
|`Polyhedra.jl`, `CDDLib.jl` | Julia Polyhedra library and the CDD backend.|

The visualization routines are deferred to the corresponding `LazySets.jl`, such as
`plot_polygon`, implemented in `Polygon.jl`.

This module is accompanied with a set of unit tests, available in the `test` folder.

## Available algorithms

The dictionary ``available_algorithms`` specifies the registered algorithms. Each
algorithm is registered with its name, and a dictionary value which any number
of entries. Most common entries are:

|Key|Description|
|-----|----|
|``'func'``|the corresponding function's handle|
|``'is_explicit'`` |if true, the output contains explicitly computed polygons; otherwise, the lazy-set framework is returned|

The algorithms implemented in `ReachSets/` are summarized in the following
table.

|Function name|Description|
|-------------|------|
|``lazy``     | Lazy computation (all blocks)|
|``explicit`` | Explicit computation|

For additional information on other algorithms see the documentation in their
corresponding source files.

## Projections

The final goal of any reachability computation is a sequence of points (vertices)
describing the evolution of one or more variables in time, as a function of
other variables, or a linear combination of them. This information is required
for plotting the output in two or three dimensions.

This module provides the function ``project_reach`` for the purpose of projecting
a high-dimensional explicit or lazy set computation into a low number of variables
efficiently. Additionally, the time variable can be passed (use `0`), and an arbitrary
linear combination of state variables can be handled as well.

## Helper functions and macros

This module provides commonly used

|Macro or function name| Description|
|-----|-----|
|``@filename_to_png``|Convert the current script name's suffix to ".png"|
|``@block_id v``| Return the block number associated to a given variable.|
