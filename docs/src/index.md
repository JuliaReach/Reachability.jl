# Reachability.jl

`Reachability` is a [Julia](http://julialang.org) package for approximating the
reachable states and checking safety properties of affine systems.

!!! note
    The documentation of `Reachability.jl` is under construction. It only covers
    a subset of the features available in the library. If you have specific questions,
