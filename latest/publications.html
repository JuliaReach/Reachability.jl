This task is known to be computationally hard for hybrid systems. One of the main challenges is the handling of discrete transitions, including computation of intersections with invariants and guards. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a state-space decomposition approach for linear hybrid systems. This approach allows us to perform most operations in low-dimensional state space, which can lead to significant performance improvements.</em></p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="JuliaReach:-a-Toolbox-for-Set-Based-Reachability-1" href="#JuliaReach:-a-Toolbox-for-Set-Based-Reachability-1">JuliaReach: a Toolbox for Set-Based Reachability</a></h2><ul><li><strong>JuliaReach: a Toolbox for Set-Based Reachability.</strong> Sergiy Bogomolov, Marcelo Forets, Goran Frehse, Kostiantyn Potomkin, Christian Schilling.

JuliaReach consists of two main packages: Reachability, containing implementations of reachability algorithms for continuous and hybrid systems, and LazySets, a standalone library that implements state-of-the-art algorithms for calculus with convex sets. The library offers both concrete and lazy set representations, where the latter stands for the ability to delay set computations until they are needed. The choice of the programming language Julia and the accompanying documentation of our toolbox allow researchers to easily translate set-based algorithms from mathematics to software in a platform-independent way, while achieving runtime performance that is comparable to statically compiled languages. Combining lazy operations in high dimensions and explicit computations in low dimensions, JuliaReach can be applied to solve complex, large-scale problems.</em></p><p>The repeatability evaluation package for this conference tool paper is available at <a href="https://github.com/JuliaReach/HSCC2019_RE">HSCC2019_RE</a>.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="ARCH-2018-Competition-AFF-Category-Report-1" href="#ARCH-2018-Competition-AFF-Category-Report-1">ARCH 2018 Competition AFF Category Report</a></h2><ul><li><strong>ARCH-COMP18 Category Report: Continuous and Hybrid Systems with Linear Continuous Dynamics.</strong> Matthias Althoff, Stanley Bak, Xin Chen, Chuchu Fan,    Marcelo Forets, Goran Frehse, Niklas Kochdumper, Yangge Li, Sayan Mitra, Rajarshi Ray, Christian Schilling and Stefan Schupp (2018) ARCH18. 5th International Workshop on Applied Verification of Continuous and Hybrid Systems, 54: 23–52. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.29007/73mb">doi: 10.29007/73mb</a>.

The friendly competition took place as part of the workshop Applied Verification for Continuous and Hybrid Systems (ARCH) in 2018. In its second edition, 9 tools have been applied to solve six different benchmark problems in the category for linear continuous dynamics (in alphabetical order): CORA, CORA/SX, C2E2, FlowStar, HyDRA, Hylaa, Hylaa-Continuous, JuliaReach, SpaceEx, and XSpeed. This report is a snapshot of the current landscape of tools and the types of benchmarks they are particularly suited for. Due to the diversity of problems, we are not ranking tools, yet the presented results probably provide the most complete assessment of tools for the safety verification of continuous and hybrid systems with linear continuous dynamics up to this date.</em></p><p>The repeatability evaluation package for JuliaReach is available at <a href="https://github.com/JuliaReach/ARCH2018_RE">ARCH2018_RE</a>.</p><p>The repeatability evaluation packages of all tools participating in this report is available in the <a href="https://gitlab.com/goranf/ARCH-COMP">ARCH-COMP gitlab repo</a>.</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Award-to-JuliaReach-1" href="#Award-to-JuliaReach-1">Award to JuliaReach</a></h3><p>The <em>Best Friendly Competition Result</em> of the <a href="https://cps-vo.org/group/ARCH/FriendlyCompetition">2nd International Competition on Verifying Continuous and Hybrid Systems (ARCH)</a> was given to JuliaReach for the results obtained in <a href="https://github.com/JuliaReach/ARCH2018_RE">ARCH2018_RE</a> for the affine category; see the <a href="https://cps-vo.org/node/55228">announcement here</a>:</p><blockquote><p>It is our pleasure to announce that Marcelo Forets and Christian Schilling receive the ARCH 2018 Best Friendly Competition Result.

Although progress has been made in the development of efficient algorithms for affine dynamical systems, available algorithms still lack scalability to ensure their wide adoption in the industrial setting. While modern linear algebra packages are efficient for matrices with tens of thousands of dimensions, set-based image computations are limited to a few hundred. We propose to decompose reach set computations such that set operations are performed in low dimensions, while matrix operations like exponentiation are carried out in the full dimension. Our method is applicable both in dense- and discrete-time settings. For a set of standard benchmarks, it shows a speed-up of up to two orders of magnitude compared to the respective state-of-the art tools, with only modest losses in accuracy. For the dense-time case, we show an experiment with more than 10.000 variables, roughly two orders of magnitude higher than possible with previous approaches.</em></p><p>For the models with the SLICOT benchmarks and the repeatability evaluation see <a href="https://github.com/JuliaReach/ReachabilityBenchmarks">ReachabilityBenchmarks</a>.</p><footer><hr/><a class="previous" href="lib/distributed.html"><span class="direction">Previous</span><span class="title">Distributed computations</span></a><a class="next" href="citations.html"><span class="direction">Next</span><span class="title">Citations</span></a></footer></article></body></html>
