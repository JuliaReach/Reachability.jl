For nonlinear reachability we combine functionality from <a href="https://github.com/JuliaIntervals/TaylorModels.jl/">Taylor-Models.jl</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiff/TaylorSeries.jl">TaylorSeries.jl</a> and <a href="https://github.com/PerezHz/TaylorIntegration.jl">TaylorIntegration.jl</a>. First, we compute a non-validated integration using a Taylor model of  order <code>nT</code>. The coefficients of that series are polynomials of ordern <code>Q</code> in the variables that denote the small variations of the initial conditions. We obtain a time step from the last two coefficients of this time series. In order to validate the  integration step, we compute a second integration using intervals as coefficients of the polynomials in time, and we obtain a bound for the integration using a Lagrange-like remainder. The remainder is used to check the contraction of a Picard iteration. If the combination of the time step and the remainder do not satisfy the contraction, we iteratively enlarge the remainder or possibly shrink the time step. Finally, we evaluate the initial Taylor series with the valid remainder at the time step for which the contraction has been proved, which is also evaluated in the initial box of deviations from the central initial condition, to yield an over-approximation. The approach is (numerically) sound due to rigorous interval bounds in the Taylor approximation.</p></blockquote><h2 id="ARCH-2019-Competition-AFF-Category-Report-1"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#ARCH-2019-Competition-AFF-Category-Report-1">ARCH 2019 Competition AFF Category Report</a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#ARCH-2019-Competition-AFF-Category-Report-1" title="Permalink"></a></h2><ul><li><strong>ARCH-COMP19 Category Report: Continuous and Hybrid Systems with Linear Continuous Dynamics.</strong> Matthias Althoff, Stanley Bak, Marcelo Forets, Goran Frehse, Niklas Kochdumper, Rajarshi Ray, Christian Schilling and Stefan Schupp (2019) ARCH19. 6th International Workshop on Applied Verification of Continuous and Hybrid Systems, vol 61, pages 14–40 <a href="https://easychair.org/publications/paper/1gbP">doi: 10.29007/bj1w</a>.

JuliaReach consists of two main packages: Reachability, containing implementations of reachability algorithms for continuous and hybrid systems, and LazySets, a standalone library that implements state-of-the-art algorithms for calculus with convex sets. The library offers both concrete and lazy set representations, where the latter stands for the ability to delay set computations until they are needed. The choice of the programming language Julia and the accompanying documentation of our toolbox allow researchers to easily translate set-based algorithms from mathematics to software in a platform-independent way, while achieving runtime performance that is comparable to statically compiled languages. Combining lazy operations in high dimensions and explicit computations in low dimensions, JuliaReach can be applied to solve complex, large-scale problems.</em></p><p>The repeatability evaluation package for this conference tool paper is available at <a href="https://github.com/JuliaReach/HSCC2019_RE">HSCC2019_RE</a>.</p><h2 id="ARCH-2018-Competition-AFF-Category-Report-1"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#ARCH-2018-Competition-AFF-Category-Report-1">ARCH 2018 Competition AFF Category Report</a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#ARCH-2018-Competition-AFF-Category-Report-1" title="Permalink"></a></h2><ul><li><strong>ARCH-COMP18 Category Report: Continuous and Hybrid Systems with Linear Continuous Dynamics.</strong> Matthias Althoff, Stanley Bak, Xin Chen, Chuchu Fan,    Marcelo Forets, Goran Frehse, Niklas Kochdumper, Yangge Li, Sayan Mitra, Rajarshi Ray, Christian Schilling and Stefan Schupp (2018) ARCH18. 5th International Workshop on Applied Verification of Continuous and Hybrid Systems, 54: 23–52. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.29007/73mb">doi: 10.29007/73mb</a>.

Although progress has been made in the development of efficient algorithms for affine dynamical systems, available algorithms still lack scalability to ensure their wide adoption in the industrial setting. While modern linear algebra packages are efficient for matrices with tens of thousands of dimensions, set-based image computations are limited to a few hundred. We propose to decompose reach set computations such that set operations are performed in low dimensions, while matrix operations like exponentiation are carried out in the full dimension. Our method is applicable both in dense- and discrete-time settings. For a set of standard benchmarks, it shows a speed-up of up to two orders of magnitude compared to the respective state-of-the art tools, with only modest losses in accuracy. For the dense-time case, we show an experiment with more than 10.000 variables, roughly two orders of magnitude higher than possible with previous approaches.</em></p><p>For the models with the SLICOT benchmarks and the repeatability evaluation see <a href="https://github.com/JuliaReach/ReachabilityBenchmarks">ReachabilityBenchmarks</a>.</p></article><nav class="docs-footer"><a class="docs-footer-prevpage" href="../lib/distributed/">« Distributed computations</a><a class="docs-footer-nextpage" href="../citations/">Citations »</a></nav></div><div class="modal" id="documenter-settings"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Settings</p><button class="delete"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><p><label class="label">Theme</label><div class="select"><select id="documenter-themepicker"><option value="documenter-light">documenter-light</option><option value="documenter-dark">documenter-dark</option></select></div></p><hr/><p>This document was generated with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> on <span class="colophon-date" title="Sunday 15 December 2019 11:22">Sunday 15 December 2019</span>.
