More details are given below.\n\nAlgorithm\n\nThe implementation of normalize exploits MathematicalSystems's' types, which carry information about the problem as a type parameter.\n\nHomogeneous ODEs of the form x = Ax x  mathcalX are canonical if the associated problem is a ConstrainedLinearContinuousSystem and A is a matrix. This type does not handle non-deterministic inputs.\n\nNote that a LinearContinuousSystem does not consider constraints on the state-space (such as an invariant); to specify state constraints, use a ConstrainedLinearContinuousSystem. If the passed system is a LinearContinuousSystem (i.e. no constraints) then the normalization fixes a universal set (Universe) as the constraint set.\n\nThe generalization to canonical systems with constraints and possibly time-varying non-deterministic inputs is considered next. These systems are of the form x = Ax + u u  mathcalU x  mathcalX. The system type is ConstrainedLinearControlContinuousSystem, where A is a matrix, X is a set and U is an input, that is, any concrete subtype of AbstractInput.\n\nIf U is not given as an input, normalization accepts either a LazySet, or a vector of LazySets. In these cases, the sets are wrapped around an appropriate concrete input type.\n\nIf the system does not conform to a canonical form, the implementation tries to make the transformation; otherwise an error is thrown. In particular, ODEs of the form x = Ax + Bu are mapped into x = Ax + u u  BmathcalU, where now u has the same dimensions as x.\n\nThe transformations described above are analogous in the discrete case, i.e. x_k+1 = A x_k and x_k+1 = Ax_k + u_k u_k  mathcalU x_k  mathcalX for the linear and affine cases respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"about/#About-1","page":"About","title":"About","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"about/#","page":"About","title":"About","text":"This page contains some general information about this project, and recommendations about contributing.","category":"page"},{"location":"about/#","page":"About","title":"About","text":"Pages = [\"about.md\"]","category":"page"},{"location":"about/#Contributing-1","page":"About","title":"Contributing","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"about/#","page":"About","title":"About","text":"If you like this package, consider contributing!

For nonlinear reachability we combine functionality from Taylor-Models.jl, TaylorSeries.jl and TaylorIntegration.jl. First, we compute a non-validated integration using a Taylor model of  order nT. The coefficients of that series are polynomials of ordern Q in the variables that denote the small variations of the initial conditions. We obtain a time step from the last two coefficients of this time series. In order to validate the  integration step, we compute a second integration using intervals as coefficients of the polynomials in time, and we obtain a bound for the integration using a Lagrange-like remainder. The remainder is used to check the contraction of a Picard iteration. If the combination of the time step and the remainder do not satisfy the contraction, we iteratively enlarge the remainder or possibly shrink the time step. Finally, we evaluate the initial Taylor series with the valid remainder at the time step for which the contraction has been proved, which is also evaluated in the initial box of deviations from the central initial condition, to yield an over-approximation. The approach is (numerically) sound due to rigorous interval bounds in the Taylor approximation.","category":"page"},{"location":"publications/#ARCH-2019-Competition-AFF-Category-Report-1","page":"Publications","title":"ARCH 2019 Competition AFF Category Report","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"publications/#","page":"Publications","title":"Publications","text":"ARCH-COMP19 Category Report: Continuous and Hybrid Systems with Linear Continuous Dynamics.

Reachability analysis aims at identifying states reachable by a system within a given time horizon. This task is known to be computationally hard for hybrid systems. One of the main challenges is the handling of discrete transitions, including computation of intersections with invariants and guards. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a state-space decomposition approach for linear hybrid systems. This approach allows us to perform most operations in low-dimensional state space, which can lead to significant performance improvements.","category":"page"},{"location":"publications/#JuliaReach:-a-Toolbox-for-Set-Based-Reachability-1","page":"Publications","title":"JuliaReach: a Toolbox for Set-Based Reachability","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"publications/#","page":"Publications","title":"Publications","text":"JuliaReach: a Toolbox for Set-Based Reachability.

We present JuliaReach, a toolbox for set-based reachability analysis of dynamical systems. JuliaReach consists of two main packages: Reachability, containing implementations of reachability algorithms for continuous and hybrid systems, and LazySets, a standalone library that implements state-of-the-art algorithms for calculus with convex sets. The library offers both concrete and lazy set representations, where the latter stands for the ability to delay set computations until they are needed. The choice of the programming language Julia and the accompanying documentation of our toolbox allow researchers to easily translate set-based algorithms from mathematics to software in a platform-independent way, while achieving runtime performance that is comparable to statically compiled languages. Combining lazy operations in high dimensions and explicit computations in low dimensions, JuliaReach can be applied to solve complex, large-scale problems.","category":"page"},{"location":"publications/#","page":"Publications","title":"Publications","text":"The repeatability evaluation package for this conference tool paper is available at HSCC2019_RE.","category":"page"},{"location":"publications/#ARCH-2018-Competition-AFF-Category-Report-1","page":"Publications","title":"ARCH 2018 Competition AFF Category Report","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"publications/#","page":"Publications","title":"Publications","text":"ARCH-COMP18 Category Report: Continuous and Hybrid Systems with Linear Continuous Dynamics.

Approximating the set of reachable states of a dynamical system is an algorithmic yet mathematically rigorous way to reason about its safety. Although progress has been made in the development of efficient algorithms for affine dynamical systems, available algorithms still lack scalability to ensure their wide adoption in the industrial setting. While modern linear algebra packages are efficient for matrices with tens of thousands of dimensions, set-based image computations are limited to a few hundred. We propose to decompose reach set computations such that set operations are performed in low dimensions, while matrix operations like exponentiation are carried out in the full dimension. Our method is applicable both in dense- and discrete-time settings. For a set of standard benchmarks, it shows a speed-up of up to two orders of magnitude compared to the respective state-of-the art tools, with only modest losses in accuracy. For the dense-time case, we show an experiment with more than 10.000 variables, roughly two orders of magnitude higher than possible with previous approaches.","category":"page"},{"location":"publications/#","page":"Publications","title":"Publications","text":"For the models with the SLICOT benchmarks and the repeatability evaluation see ReachabilityBenchmarks.","category":"page"},{"location":"lib/interface/#User-interface-1","page":"User interface","title":"User interface","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"lib/interface/#","page":"User interface","title":"User interface","text":"This section of the manual describes the main user interface.","category":"page"},{"location":"lib/interface/#","page":"User interface","title":"User interface","text":"Pages = [\"interface.md\"]","category":"page"},{"location":"lib/interface/#","page":"User interface","title":"User interface","text":"CurrentModule = Reachability","category":"page"},{"location":"lib/interface/#Posing-and-solving-a-reachability-problem-1","page":"User interface","title":"Posing and solving a reachability problem","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"lib/interface/#","page":"User interface","title":"User interface","text":"A reachability problem is characterized by an AbstractSystem together with an Options structure.","category":"page"},{"location":"lib/interface/#","page":"User interface","title":"User interface","text":"solve","category":"page"},{"location":"lib/interface/#Reachability.solve","page":"User interface","title":"Reachability.solve","text":"solve(system, options)  or  solve(system, :key1 => val1, [...], keyK => valK)\n\nSolves a reachability problem s.t. the given options.

We begin by explaining the default options used by the algorithm. Then we show how to specify the computation of a subset of the flowpipe, which helps to improve performance, specially for large systems.\n\nWe continue to show some lower-level options such as how to specify a custom block decomposition (the set types used and the sizes of the blocks). \n\nWe conclude showing that there are two different modes of operation: flowpipe computation and safety property checking, and examples of use.\n\nRunning example and default options\n\nBy default, BFFPSV18 uses a uniform partition of dimension one over all variables.\n\nFor example, consider the two-dimensional example from [2]:\n\njulia> using Reachability, MathematicalSystems\n\njulia> A = [-1. -4   0  0   0;\n             4  -1   0  0   0;\n             0   0  -3  1   0;\n             0   0  -1  3   0;\n             0   0   0  0  -2];\n\njulia> X₀ = BallInf(ones(5), 0.1);\n\njulia> problem = InitialValueProblem(LinearContinuousSystem(A), X₀);\n\njulia> sol = solve(problem, Options(:T=>5.0), op=BFFPSV18(Options(:δ=>0.04)));\n\nLet's check that the dimension of the first set computed is 5:\n\njulia> X₁ = set(first(first(sol.flowpipes).reachsets));\n\njulia> dim(X₁)\n5\n\njulia> sol.options[:partition]\n5-element Array{Array{Int64,1},1}:\n [1]\n [2]\n [3]\n [4]\n [5]\n\nHere, [1] corresponds to a block of size one for variable 5, etc., until variable 5. Let's check the set type used is Interval:\n\njulia> all(Xi isa Interval for Xi in array(X₁))\ntrue\n\nSpecifying a subset of all variables\n\nSuppose that we are only interested in variables 1 and 2. Then we can specify it using the :vars option:\n\njulia> sol = solve(problem, Options(:T=>5.0),\n                   op=BFFPSV18(Options(:δ=>0.04, :vars=>[1, 2])));\n\njulia> X₁ = set(first(first(sol.flowpipes).reachsets));\n\njulia> dim(X₁)\n2\n\nThe sets used are Intervals:\n\njulia> all(Xi isa Interval for Xi in array(X₁))\ntrue\n\nSpecifying the set type\n\nWe can as well specify using other set types for the overapproximation of the flowpipe, such as hyperrectangles. It can be specified using the :overapproximation option:\n\njulia> sol = solve(problem, Options(:T=>5.0),\n                   op=BFFPSV18(Options(:δ=>0.04, :vars=>[1, 2],\n                                       :block_options=>Hyperrectangle)));\n\njulia> X₁ = set(first(first(sol.flowpipes).reachsets));\n\njulia> all(Xi isa Hyperrectangle for Xi in array(X₁))\ntrue\n\nTo increase the accuracy, the overapproximation option offers other possibilities. For example, one can use template directions instead of a fixed set type. Below we use octagonal directions:\n\njulia> sol = solve(problem, Options(:T=>5.0),\n                   op=BFFPSV18(Options(:δ=>0.04, :vars=>[1, 2],\n                                       :block_options=>OctDirections)));\n\njulia> X₁ = set(first(first(sol.flowpipes).reachsets));\n\njulia> all(Xi isa HPolytope for Xi in array(X₁))\ntrue\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Reach Set Approximation through Decomposition with Low-dimensional Sets and High-dimensional Matrices.
